#+TITLE: frctl

A cli for generating fractals.

* About
Currently this only generates a rendering of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set#Basic_properties][Mandelbrot set.]]
* Usage
#+begin_src bash
cargo build --release

# to see all the options
./target/release/frctl --help

# to generate an interesting picture
./target/release/frctl -r '-0.5557506' -i '-0.55560' -w 1024 -h 1024 fractal.png
#+end_src

* Credit
This project started from [[https://github.com/abour/fractal][this repo]]. I stripped it back to a synchronous version
to work on modularizing the code as my final intent is to be able to create a
more general CLI for rendering fractals.
